# BasicSparkStreaming



The NYC Taxi Rides Data Project focuses on real-time data streaming and analysis using a combination of Apache Kafka, Spark Streaming, and Docker. It starts with collecting NYC taxi ride data and setting up a continuous data flow through Kafka. The project leverages Spark Streaming to process the incoming data, enabling the analysis of key metrics such as average trip duration and peak hours. The results are then stored in a database or file system for further insights. The entire project is containerized using Docker for portability and ease of deployment.
